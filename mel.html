    <h2 id="txt3">I guess its pretty obvious why does everyone likes this grumpy ass man. HE HAS THE
        FLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAVOUR, if
        you know what I mean. Thats the thing: liking characters that, if they existed, they would never give you a
        chance... BUT maybe thats the flavour that im talking about. PERIOD!!!!!!!</h2>

    <h1 id="tit2">RESIDENT EVIL (and my poor experience, lol)</h1>

    <h3 id="txt4">Without being ironic (im being SERIOUS) ive played a little bit of Resident Evil. The first version of
        the
        fouth game, the second, remastered, and the third, once again, remastered. AND GUESS WHAT? I KNEW HIM BEFORE
        EVEN KNOWING ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF THE GAME. I wish I was kidding but, fr, this guy its iconic. Not just him,
        but RE in general!

        Unfortunately I havent played much, but im WILLING to. Resident Evil is such a peak game, all of them, I guess.

        NO BULLYING ON ME, OK?

        this guy,

        LOL! (jk ok) There are much more characters. BEAUTIFUL ONES. Chris, Jill, Carlos, Luis (i luv this silly, silly
        man), Wesker... sometimes I just forget that Resident Evil is an horror game and not an fashion one, bc, DAWG!!

        mean, I
        understand all the fans getting pissed off because of people that <i>pretend</i> to be the number one fan of
        something that they dont even know how the lore starts. I TRULY understand. BUT. ITS OK SIMPING OVER A CHARACTER
        JS BCS HES GOOD LOOKING. I mean, we already do it with people in irl... so...</h3>
